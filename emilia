alex "Suspended? That's not normal. Line A is the engine of the city. (Scans the platform, recognizing the others.) The faces... I’ve seen this exact disappointment before. I’ve felt this exact moment of inertia."

"The Status Quo Revealed: Alex is trapped in a psycho-temporal loop. The routine has become a time loop because it lacks conscious intention and is fueled only by stagnation. The train cannot move Alex forward until the underlying psychological blockage is cleared."
